<a id="welcome-to-gshell" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-gshell" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to gShell!</h2>

<p>gShell is here to help you access and manage information from your Google Apps domain through the PowerShell scripting language. Please keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki">Wiki</a> for what is available; this is a work in progress done in my spare time, so things are added irregularly but as frequently as possible. Did I mention your hair looks great today?</p>

<h4>
<a id="whats-new" class="anchor" href="#whats-new" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's New?</h4>

<p>Version 0.0.5.0 is almost released with a better-than-ever installer, new *GAUserProperties cmdlets that let you add, edit and (almost) remove extended properties, and a brand new wiki with a ton of content. The cmdlets will use the built-in Online Help feature that will redirect you to the appropriate web page to get the help, and will try to stay web-based since you need to be online to use them anyways.</p>

<p>Want to help make this project even better? I'm looking for contributors in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing code and submitting bug-fixes or new or expanded functionality</li>
<li>Writing documentation for the wiki or for the help xml files, especially with examples and usage information</li>
<li>Identifying bugs and things that need fixing</li>
<li>Ideas on how to make it better and what to add next!</li>
</ul>

<p>As always if you're interested or have any thoughts or questions, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Discussion-Groups">Discussion Groups</a> and let me know!</p>

<a id="quick-examples" class="anchor" href="#quick-examples" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Examples</h4>

<p>The goal of gShell is to allow you quick and easy access to your Google Apps domain. Down the road, I hope to expand it to include additional google APIs that can be used with <em>ANY</em> Google-based account. Check out some of the following examples to see how this can be helpful to you, once you get past the <em>quick setup</em>.</p>

<p>First, you can grab a user from your domain and get it back as a <em>GAUser</em> object:</p>

<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; Get-GAUser BMcGee mydomain.com

GivenName     : Bobby
FamilyName    : McGee
PrimaryEmail  : bmcgee@mydomain.com
Aliases       : {bobbymcgee@mydomain.com, bobmcgee@mydomain.com}
Suspended     : False
OrgUnitPath   : /
LastLoginTime : 2013-10-25T05:10:40.000Z
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can elect to get all users in the domain and throw them in a variable, perhaps to compare against your AD Environment:</p>

<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; $AllUsers = Get-GAUser -all

----
PS C:\&gt; $AllUsers.Count

9001
</code></pre>

<p>Better yet, perhaps you need to get a list of all users in all groups? in the domain...</p>

<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; $AllGroups = Get-GAGroup mydomain.com -All -Members -Owners
#A progress bar will show up for this, since it's potentially a long wait

----
PS C:\&gt; $AllGroups.Count

42
</code></pre>

<p>...or you want to find all members of all groups, and throw that in a list for easy export to CSV? Got that covered:</p>

<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; $AllMembers = (Get-GAGroupMember -All).ToSingleList()

----
PS C:\&gt; $AllMembers[0]

Email : bobbymcgee@mydomain.com
ETag  : "01...HQ"
Id    : 12..89
Kind  : admin#directory#member
Role  : MEMBER
Type  : USER
Group : songcharacters@mydomain.com

----
PS C:\&gt; $AllMembers | Export-Csv -Path "C:\AllGroupMemberships.csv" -NoTypeInformation

----
PS C:\&gt; (Get-Content "C:\AllDomainGroupMemberships.csv")[0..1]
#Let's look directly at the CSV file...

"Email","ETag","Id","Kind","Role","Type","Group"
,"""01..HQ""","12..89","admin#directory#member","MEMBER","USER"
,"songcharacters@mydomain.com"
</code></pre>

<p>This is the tip of the iceberg of what's possible and what's available. If you need help or have questions, requests or you found a bug, drop a line in the <a href="https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Discussion-Groups">Discussion Groups</a>.</p>
