{"name":"gShell","tagline":"PowerShell Cmdlets and .Net Libraries for Google Apps and Gmail APIs","body":"#Welcome to gShell!\r\n\r\n###What is gShell?\r\ngShell is a project that primarily aims to make all Google APIs available through Microsoft PowerShell, starting with the Administrative APIs. As a result, gShell also provides dotNet developers with a framework to ease the burden of [authenticating and calling on the APIs in dotNet](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/DotNet-Guide).\r\n\r\n###PowerShell Cmdlets for Google APIs\r\ngShell is a toolset that is here to help you access and manage information from your Google Apps domain through [Windows PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell). The goal is to be the only set of Cmdlets you'll need to use the Google APIs in PowerShell, though it's a long road.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Getting-Started) page to get going, or hop over to [Downloads](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Downloads) if you want to dive in with the installer. [If you want to see what's new, check out the News page!](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/News)\r\n\r\nPlease keep an eye on the documentation here in the [Wiki](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki) for what is available; this is a work in progress done in my spare time so things are added irregularly but as frequently as possible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm always open to adding something new, so if there is a particular API that you want to use that I don't have yet, [let me know](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Discussion-Groups)!\r\n\r\n####Quick Examples####\r\nThe idea of gShell is to allow you quick and easy access to your Google Apps domain. Down the road, I hope to expand it to include additional Google APIs that can be used with _ANY_ Google-based account. Check out some of the following examples to see how this can be helpful to you, once you get past the [quick setup](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Getting-Started).\r\n\r\nFirst, you can grab a user from your domain and get it back as a [GAUser](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/GAUser) object:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> Get-GAUser BMcGee mydomain.com\r\n\r\nGivenName     : Bobby\r\nFamilyName    : McGee\r\nPrimaryEmail  : bmcgee@mydomain.com\r\nAliases       : {bobbymcgee@mydomain.com, bobmcgee@mydomain.com}\r\nSuspended     : False\r\nOrgUnitPath   : /\r\nLastLoginTime : 2013-10-25T05:10:40.000Z\r\n```\r\nOr, you can elect to get all users in the domain and throw them in a variable, perhaps to compare against your AD Environment:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> $AllUsers = Get-GAUser -all\r\n\r\n----\r\nPS C:\\> $AllUsers.Count\r\n\r\n9001\r\n```\r\n\r\nBetter yet, perhaps you need to get a list of all users in all [groups](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/GAGroup) in the domain...\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> $AllGroups = Get-GAGroup mydomain.com -All -Members -Owners\r\n#A progress bar will show up for this, since it's potentially a long wait\r\n\r\n----\r\nPS C:\\> $AllGroups.Count\r\n\r\n42\r\n```\r\n...or you want to find all members of all groups, and throw that in a list for easy export to CSV Got that covered:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> $AllMembers = (Get-GAGroupMember -All).ToSingleList()\r\n\r\n----\r\nPS C:\\> $AllMembers[0]\r\n\r\nEmail : bobbymcgee@mydomain.com\r\nETag  : \"01...rs/44...HQ\"\r\nId    : 123456789123456789123\r\nKind  : admin#directory#member\r\nRole  : MEMBER\r\nType  : USER\r\nGroup : songcharacters@mydomain.com\r\n\r\n----\r\nPS C:\\> $AllMembers | Export-Csv -Path \"C:\\AllGroupMemberships.csv\" -NoTypeInformation\r\n\r\n----\r\nPS C:\\> (Get-Content \"C:\\AllDomainGroupMemberships.csv\")[0..1]\r\n#Let's look directly at the CSV file...\r\n\r\n\"Email\",\"ETag\",\"Id\",\"Kind\",\"Role\",\"Type\",\"Group\"\r\n,\"\"\"01...rs/44...HQ\"\"\",\"12...23\",\"admin#directory#member\",\"MEMBER\",\"USER\"\r\n,\"songcharacters@mydomain.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the tip of the iceberg of what's possible and what's available. If you need help or have questions, requests or you found a bug, drop a line in the [discussion group](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Discussion-Groups).\r\n\r\nStay tuned, and please reach out if you have any questions, concerns or requests.\r\n","google":"UA-58705092-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
